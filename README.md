# Welcome!

This is the React app code for a project I built (for a Full Stack course).


The app is used for managing TV Shows, Members (members have a subscription for watching TV Shows) and Users (users have different permissions and by them can view, create, update or delete members and shows).


You can view the deployed app at https://davidi-74.github.io/shows-project/.


You can view the Node.JS servers' code at https://github.com/Davidi-74/users-server and https://github.com/Davidi-74/shows-server (they are in different repositories as they are hosted via Heroku).


Under src/appReducer.js is Redux' Reducer.


Under src/comps are all the components that are used across the entire project.


The rest of the components are filed into different folders by topic:

*Members

*Movies

*Subscriptions (the TV Shows that the members are subsctibed to).

*Users
